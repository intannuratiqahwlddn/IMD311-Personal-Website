				<h5>MY FAMILY</h5>
				<p><strong>Let me introduce my small family.</strong></p>
					<p><br>From the top right is my father, Mior Awaluddin bin Mior Mokhtar, who works as a bank officer. He is a great father who lets us do anything that we love and gives us endless support. He taught us to be independent in facing the world so we would not feel scared when we are alone.</p><p><br>Next to my father is my mother, Intan Nazira Binti Nazri, a queen of the house who teaches us the meaning of love. She is the backbone of the happy family that teaches us to be respectful, intelligent, and caring for each other.</p><p><br>Next is the one with a white scarf that holds a cat. She is me, Intan Nuratiqah Binti Mior Awaluddin, a student of UiTM Rembau. The cat that I hold is our youngest in the family, and her name is Snow. She is photogenic and never stays still. She is an introverted but easy-going cat who lets anyone touch her.</p><p><br>Next is my brother, who wears a "songkok," Mior Aniq Zikri Bin Mior Awaluddin. He is the youngest in the family and the most spoiled. He loves to play games but is also gifted. I never see him study, but he always gets the highest score on every exam.</p><p><br>My third sibling is Mior Aniq Zakwan. He is our main chef in the house because he never parted ways with the kitchen. He loves to cook, shop, and watch Korean dramas. He is a gentleman who is always there for me whenever I need him.</p><P><br><img src="images/sister.jpg" alt="sister picture" width="20%"><br>Lastly is my older sister, who is not in the picture because she couldn’t join us for the Hari Raya Celebration because of COVID-19, Intan Nuramirah Binti Mior Awaluddin. She is the person that I adore so much because she always cares for us whenever my parents have to go outstation due to work. She always sets a good example and teaches me how to be an independent woman.</p>
